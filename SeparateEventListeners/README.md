# Color-Changing GUI with Exit Confirmation

---

This Java Swing application creates a window with three buttons labeled "Red," "Green," and "Blue."
Clicking any button changes the background color of the main panel to the corresponding color. 
The program uses a reusable ColorListener class that applies the selected color to any target component.
Additionally, when the user tries to close the window, a custom confirmation dialog appears asking if they really want to exit.
The dialog features large, custom-styled buttons ("Exit" and "Cancel") to improve usability.

The application demonstrates event-driven programming, custom listeners, and user-friendly exit handling in a Swing GUI.
