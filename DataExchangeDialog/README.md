# üñ•Ô∏è Java Swing Login Dialog with GridBagLayout

This Java Swing application demonstrates the use of a modal login dialog box with GridBagLayout and a custom helper class GBC to simplify layout management.
The main window contains a "Login" button that opens a dialog prompting the user for a username and password.
If both fields are filled and submitted, the credentials are printed to the console. 
The layout is made cleaner and more readable using the GBC utility class, which wraps GridBagConstraints for easier configuration.
