Let’s explore a little more what we mean by an infrastructure that provides
services to applications. To this end, suppose you have an exciting new idea for a dis-
tributed Internet application, one that may greatly benefit humanity or one that may
simply make you rich and famous. How might you go about transforming this idea
into an actual Internet application? Because applications run on end systems, you are
going to need to write programs that run on the end systems. You might, for example,
write your programs in Java, C, or Python. Now, because you are developing a dis-
tributed Internet application, the programs running on the different end systems will
need to send data to each other. And here we get to a central issue—one that leads
to the alternative way of describing the Internet as a platform for applications. How
does one program running on one end system instruct the Internet to deliver data to
another program running on another end system?
