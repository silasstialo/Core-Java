End systems attached to the Internet provide a socket interface that speci-
fies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to
deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system. This
Internet socket interface is a set of rules that the sending program must follow so
that the Internet can deliver the data to the destination program. We’ll discuss the
Internet socket interface in detail in Chapter 2. For now, let’s draw upon a simple
analogy, one that we will frequently use in this book. Suppose Alice wants to send
a letter to Bob using the postal service. Alice, of course, can’t just write the letter
(the data) and drop the letter out her window. Instead, the postal service requires
that Alice put the letter in an envelope; write Bob’s full name, address, and zip
code in the center of the envelope; seal the envelope; put a stamp in the upper-
right-hand corner of the envelope; and finally, drop the envelope into an official
postal service mailbox. Thus, the postal service has its own “postal service inter-
face,” or set of rules, that Alice must follow to have the postal service deliver her
letter to Bob. In a similar manner, the Internet has a socket interface that the pro-
gram sending data must follow to have the Internet deliver the data to the program
that will receive the data
