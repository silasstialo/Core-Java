End systems are connected together by a network of communication links and
packet switches. Weâ€™ll see in Section 1.2 that there are many types of communica-
tion links, which are made up of different types of physical media, including coaxial
cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum. Different links can transmit
data at different rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second.
When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system
segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages
of information, known as packets in the jargon of computer networks, are then sent
through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into
the original data.
