ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be interconnected. These lower-
tier ISPs are thus interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs
and these upper-tier ISPs are connected directly to each other. An upper-tier ISP
consists of high-speed routers interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic links. Each
ISP network, whether upper-tier or lower-tier, is managed independently, runs the
IP protocol (see below), and conforms to certain naming and address conventions.
Weâ€™ll examine ISPs and their interconnection more closely in Section 1.3.
