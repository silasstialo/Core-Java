# Custom Exception Example: Name Length Validation
This Java program demonstrates how to create and use a custom checked exception NameTooLongException.
It checks whether a given name (ignoring spaces) exceeds 30 characters.
If the name is too long, the exception is thrown with a descriptive error message. 
Otherwise, it prints a confirmation message. 
The main method tests this behavior by passing a long name and handling the exception gracefully.
