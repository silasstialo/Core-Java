Our discussion above has identified many of the pieces that make up the Internet.
But we can also describe the Internet from an entirely different angle—namely, as
an infrastructure that provides services to applications. In addition to traditional
applications such as e-mail and Web surfing, Internet applications include mobile
smartphone and tablet applications, including Internet messaging, mapping with
real-time road-traffic information, music streaming movie and television streaming,
online social media, video conferencing, multi-person games, and location-based
recommendation systems. The applications are said to be distributed applications,
since they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other. Impor-
tantly, Internet applications run on end systems—they do not run in the packet
switches in the network core. Although packet switches facilitate the exchange of
data among end systems, they are not concerned with the application that is the
source or sink of data.
