End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols that
control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet. The Transmission

that are sent and received among routers and end systems. The Internet’s principal
protocols are collectively known as TCP/IP. We’ll begin looking into protocols in
this introductory chapter. But that’s just a start—much of this book is concerned with
