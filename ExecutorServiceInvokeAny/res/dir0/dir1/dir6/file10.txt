A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication
links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. Packet
switches come in many shapes and flavors, but the two most prominent types in
todayâ€™s Internet are routers and link-layer switches. Both types of switches forward
packets toward their ultimate destinations. Link-layer switches are typically used in
access networks, while routers are typically used in the network core. The sequence
of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the send-
ing end system to the receiving end system is known as a route or path through
the network. Cisco predicts annual global IP traffic will reach nearly five zettabytes
(1021 bytes) by 2022 [Cisco VNI 2020].
