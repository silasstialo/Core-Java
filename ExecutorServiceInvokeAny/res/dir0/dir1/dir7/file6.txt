Packet-switched networks (which transport packets) are in many ways
similar to transportation networks of highways, roads, and intersections (which
transport vehicles). Consider, for example, a factory that needs to move a large
amount of cargo to some destination warehouse located thousands of kilometers
away. At the factory, the cargo is segmented and loaded into a fleet of trucks.
Each of the trucks then independently travels through the network of highways,
roads, and intersections to the destination warehouse. At the destination ware-
house, the cargo is unloaded and grouped with the rest of the cargo arriving
from the same shipment. Thus, in many ways, packets are analogous to trucks,
communication links are analogous to highways and roads, packet switches are
analogous to intersections, and end systems are analogous to buildings. Just as
a truck takes a path through the transportation network, a packet takes a path
through a computer network.
