# Using a color chooser in Java
A simple Java Swing application that demonstrates the use of JColorChooser within a dialog.
A large-font button labeled “Select a Color” is placed at the bottom (BorderLayout.SOUTH). When clicked, it opens a color chooser dialog, and as the user picks a color, the background of the window dynamically updates in real-time.
This example showcases interactive GUI event handling and color selection in Java Swing.
