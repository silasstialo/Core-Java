# üìÅ Java Swing File Chooser Example

---

This Java Swing application demonstrates how to use JFileChooser to:

- Open image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif) using a file filter.

- Select a directory for saving files.

- The GUI includes two large buttons:

***"Open A file"*** (top): lets the user choose an image file from their file system.

***"Save a file"*** (bottom): lets the user select a directory to "save" to.

Paths of selected files or folders are printed to the console. The layout is responsive, and tooltips and fonts are customized for better user experience.
